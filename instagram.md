title: Your Trusted Marketing Advisor
---

<span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is a boutique consulting practice that helps companies define and build digital marketing capabilities.

Our work with media companies such as **The New York Times** and **Complex Media** focuses on audience development, SEO and content distribution.

Our work with startups such as **Olapic** and **Hipmunk** focuses on providing marketing guidance, leadership and strategy to help build the marketing engine.

We're small, intentionally. Which means we can work on problems that are ill defined. Not everything has to fit inside a box. That said, here are the most common ways that we engage with clients: 

## Strategy Workshops

Face to face workshops - where we bring research to the table and challenge assumptions. These sessions can be incredibly valuable, not only as a way of moving forward but also as a way of aligning and identifying future work projects.

## Embedded Marketing Strategy

The next step is usually getting as close to your team as possible - to understand the dynamics and to understand the business. Most work is done project-based where we define specific needs or problems and address them with speed. This ongoing work often revolves around the core principle of helping clients define and build new marketing capabilities - whether in content marketing, SEO, audience development or helping to lead brand positioning and market research. 

## Building Better Teams

Finding marketing talent is hard and we have a lot of experience hiring, training and leading teams of marketing and editorial talent. Think of us as something like a consultative recruiter - helping to define the needs in the first place and then helping to source the right people for the role.

## Tom + A distributed team

<span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is the consulting practice of Tom Critchlow. 90% of work is done by Tom Critchlow but we partner with trusted consultants and agencies where it makes sense and are always transparent about who's delivering the work. If we're not a good fit for a project we'll refer you to someone who is.

## Limited Availability

A personal note from Tom: Hi there, I just had my first child. She's a bundle of sunshine and I'm trying hard to be present and available for her, hopefully for her whole life but certainly for the first few years. What this means is realistically I likely only have room for one or two more clients in 2016. And if I'm a little slower to respond to emails or if there are more typos than you expect please forgive me :)
